Welcome to my personal website &amp; demo reel.
</p>
<p>
On this site, you'll find information about a large number of projects I've done and would like to demonstrate. Projects range
from those I've done for a class to club work to hobby projects. Overviews of each can be found on the 
<a href="projects.php">projects page</a>. More detailed information can be found by visiting each project's individual page.
Additionally, screenshots of projects (where applicable) can be viewed on the
<a href="screenshots.php">screenshots page</a>.
</p>
<p>
This website has been constructed entirely by me. I have used no non-standard libraries for layout, content management, or design.
This means that the page may look a little rough, but also that everything you see while visiting is something I'm entirely
capable of.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to read more about me (including my mission statement), visit the <a href="about_me.html">about me</a> page.
You can also view my <a href="resume.html">CV</a>. If you have any questions or need to get in touch, you can find my info
on the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.
