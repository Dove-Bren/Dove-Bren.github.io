About Me

<p>
My name is Skyler Manzanares, and I'm a recent graduate of New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. I've been
deeply impassioned with video games since before I can remember. It wasn't long before I began to wonder what went into
their creation, and began to explore game development for myself. Very shortly after, I fell in love with every part of
the process, and dreamt of the day when I could do what I loved for the rest of my life.
</p>
<p>
While there isn't a part of video-game development that I'm not interested in, my true talent lies in programming. Early
in my game-development junior career, I realized I loved spending time creating game engines and stubs that had the
major components of what the game needed. I would (either solo or in a team of two or three) create an idea for some
cool gameplay that would drive a game, and then work to make it from the ground up. I've always been an RPG fan, so
these usually were RPGs. However, I spent some time on everything from top-down horror shooters in 2d to 3d platformers.
As the game's major features came out, I enjoyed spending time expanding on them and making room for what could come
in the future. Unfortunately, this was about the time the projects would die; I lacked the skills to produce nice
sprites or models and textures, and had no talent as a sound/music designer. My little game stubs would make it
as far as feature-filled gamelets with modest artwork and music before being stashed for good.
</p>
<p>
My thirst for game development started with the desire to create a game I could play, and that would be fun. I knew what
I liked in a game, and I knew how to create features. It seemed a very simple thing to put both of them together to
make a game I would love and play forever. Very quickly, however, this ebbed and instead gave way to a curiosity.
Rather than being driven by the desire to have a game that did this or that that the games I was playing didn't,
I wanted to explore different mechanics through implementation. This sort of felt like thinking of mechanics and seeing
if they would be cool, while simultaneously figuring out exactly how they would work down at the code level. It was this
same mentallity that I kept as I explored all sorts of different types of games from middle school through highschool.
</p>
<p>
Game development in college was different for me than what it was before. I spent some time creating mini softwares
for silly little things, and exploring details of things like image codecs. As I was exposed to professional programming
languages and softwares, I put down game development because of my new fear for game engines: I felt that using game
engines like I was before was something to be ashamed of, and that real developers programmed things in real languages
like C++ and Java.
